## Automating boring things

- I automated my boring class that which occurs online. My online class is scheduled in an online platform called blackboard. I used the selenium package for automation. 
- Selenium is a powerful tool for controlling web browsers through programs and performing browser automation. It is functional for all browsers, works on all major OS and its scripts are written in various languages i.e Python, Java, C#, etc, we will be working with Python.
- This code is adjusted to my interent speed and daily time table.
- This code might not work straight in your machine, I do not recommend to copy paste my code.
- Take a look and build on your own.
- This repo is only for taking a look to how we can easily automate boring stuffs by using simple packages.
